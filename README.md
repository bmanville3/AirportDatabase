This was a group project for a database class. Our goal was to design from scratch a database for an airport using MySQL. The description of the airport can be found in cs4400_problem_description_v0.pdf.
Phase I of the project we made an ERD based on this description (cs4400_phase1_schema_team22-3.pdf). The professor returned cs4400_sams_phase1_erd_RETURNED.pdf to work on for Phase II.
Phase II of the project we made a relation schema, designed a database, and inserted data into the database (cs4400_phase2_schema_team22-1.pdf, cs4400_phase2_database_team22-1.sql, cs4400_sams_phase2_DENORMALIZED_data_v2.xlsx, the python file and CSV files).
Phase III, we were given cs4400_sams_phase3_database_RETURNED.sql to base the procedures on (cs4400_phase3_stored_procedures_team22.sql).
To sum up, the RETURNED files are not our work. Everything else is either our work or the problem description/data.
