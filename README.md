# About the Project
This was a group project for a database class using MySQL. Our goal was to design a database from scratch for an airport using MySQL. The scenario description can be found in cs4400_problem_description_v0.pdf.
The project is divided into 3 distinct phases; each phase depends on the last. After each phase, the professor returned his version for us to use in the next phase (to ensure there would be no errors carrying over from phase to phase).
The RETURNED files are not our work. Everything else is either our work or part of the problem description/data.

# The Files and Work Distributions
In phase I of the project we made an ERD based on this description (cs4400_phase1_schema_team22-3.pdf is our work). The professor returned cs4400_sams_phase1_erd_RETURNED.pdf to work on for Phase II.

Phase II of the project we made a relation schema, designed a database, and inserted data into the database. The relevant files: cs4400_phase2_schema_team22-1.pdf is the schema, cs4400_phase2_database_team22-1.sql is the database with the data inserted, cs4400_sams_phase2_DENORMALIZED_data_v2.xlsx was the given data, and the python file and CSV files are "assisting files". The database is based on the description and RETURNED ERD file from the professor.

In phase III, we were given cs4400_sams_phase3_database_RETURNED.sql to base the procedures on. The procedures are in cs4400_phase3_stored_procedures_team22.sql.

The other group members (to give them due credit) were Anand Singh, Luke Dean, and Nyshad Williams. I did the majority (>70%) of Phase I and II while Phase III was more evenly split (I did around 20%).
